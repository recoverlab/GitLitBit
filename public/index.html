						I've now met my “build 0” working goal, which I had set as simply being the creation of a maintainable menu for Idempotent Schema.
						So, I made up some pictures of the name, and connected a backbone, and now you can visit the bareness of a several-tiered design.
						Next, I can clean up what I've got, and think up a “build 1” working goal.
						Probably that will be the defining and connecting of the adjacent frameworking, and the establishment of a few simple authority records throughout, both to personify the environment and to distinguish arms and branches and their respective styles and emphases from one another’s.
					</div>
                    <br>
					<div style="text-align: justify">
						As I proceed with this cleaning and restructuring and interconnectivity, I'm thinking that I'll use GitLitBit as the introduction, menu, and overview of the whole extended mega-project with all its separate interests.
						GOt-CHa(?) can be for authority records, though I'll give a few here just for grace.
						GitLitBit is therefore the public origin of my online work.
